      <h2>What is this thing?</h2>
      <p>This is a calculator to help you compare the financial implications of buying
      versus renting a home. You have two scenarios, where by default in the left one
      you get a mortgage and buy a house, and in the right one you pay rent and invest
      the available capital in stocks instead. The plots and the Final values section
      show predictions for how these two scenarios might play out over time.</p>

      <p>Below are many different parameters you can tune. Hover on the little question
      marks to get more information about each one.</p>

    <p>The calculator assumes UK taxation and uses UK concepts such as leaseholds and
    ISAs. Some of the default values are based on London numbers, such as historical
    house price growth in London.</p>

    <p>The outcomes depend massively on future inflation, salary growth, house price
    growth, rent growth, and the growth of the value of any stock portfolio. These are
    all modelled probabilistically, and the value for each of these, as a percentage, is
    assumed to be normal distributed. You can set the mean and the standard deviation.
    The probabilistic nature of the simulation is why the plots at the top have error
    bars. The midline is the median, the limits are the 20th and 80th percentiles.<p>

    <p>Do remember that buying home is not only a financial decision, but affects your
    life in many ways. This calculator only tries to capture the investment aspect.</p>

    <p>This calculator is free software and its source code is here: <a
        href="https://github.com/mhauru/buyvsrent">github.com/mhauru/buyvsrent</a></p>

    <p>No one involved in making this calculator have any relevant qualifications, and
    nothing here is financial advice.</p>
