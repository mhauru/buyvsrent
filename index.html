      <h2>What is this thing?</h2>
      <p>This is a calculator to help you compare the financial implications of buying
      versus renting a home. You have two scenarios, where by default in the left one
      you get a mortgage and buy a house, and in the right one you pay rent and invest
      the available capital in stocks instead. The plots and the Final values section
      show predictions for how these two scenarios might play out over time.</p>

      <p>Below are many different parameters you can tune. Hover on the little question
      marks to get more information about each one.</p>

    <p>The calculator assumes UK taxation and uses UK concepts such as leaseholds and
    ISAs. Some of the default values are based on London numbers, such as historical
    house price growth in London. You can change those values though. Changing the
    taxation system would require editing the code.</p>

    <p>The outcomes depend massively on future inflation, salary growth, house price
    growth, rent growth, and the growth of the value of any stock portfolio. These are
    all modelled probabilistically, and the value for each of these, as a percentage, is
    assumed to be normal distributed. You can set the mean and the standard deviation.
    The probabilistic nature of the simulation is why the plots at the top have error
    bars. The midline is the median, the limits are the 20th and 80th percentiles.<p>

    <p>Do remember that buying a home is not only a financial decision, but affects your
    life in many ways. This calculator only tries to capture the investment aspect.</p>

    <p>Some caveats, things I'm not happy with in this calculator, that you should be
    aware of:
      <ul>
          <li>The default standard deviation for house price growth is probably too low.
              I've estimated it by looking at how much variation there is year-to-year in
              the price of the average house in London. But that's very different from
              how much variation there may be in the price of a single house. I'm not
              sure how to best estimate the latter though.</li>
          <li>The default values for rent growth and salary growth distributions are pure
              guesses, I have no particular reason for them.</li>
          <li>I have no idea if the assumption that the random variables are all normal
              distributed is realistic.</li>
          <li>The calculator doesn't really do variable mortgage rates. That's because it
              doesn't model central bank interest rate development in any way. There's
              probably some connection one could make there to inflation, but this would
              get quite deep into macroeconomics. So currently you can just set the
              mortgage rate you expect, and that's it.</li>
          <li>Bankruptcies are handled a bit awkwardly. Currently if you ever come to a
              situation where your yearly incomings can't cover the outgoings, all your
              wealth, stock, salary, rent etc. are set to zero. This effectively
              terminates the simulation. This may skew the distributions at the end of
              the simulation in unexpected ways.</li>
          <li>The default values I've set for ground rent, service charges, and
              maintenance costs aren't based on more than a quick online search.</li>
          <li>The time step of the simulation is a full year. Having monthly time steps
              would be more accurate.</li>
          <li>The capital gains tax calculator assumes you are in the >50k tax bracket.
          </li>
      </ul>
